  Scratch Project
  </h2>
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118987850/">
  <img src="scratch.png" height="150"> </a>
  <p> This was my very first project during my year <br>in AP CSP. We started on this project to help <br>us understand the basics of code and how <br>
  computers think and operate. </p>

  <h2> Second Scratch Project </h2>
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/119096249/">
  <img src="scratch.png" height="200"> </a>
  <p> This was my second scratch project made during my CSP year. <br> I made a program about a old meme called Epic Sax Guy. <br> 
  When C2 is pressed it will give you a little suprise! <br> Press space to stop the action. </p>

  <img src="artgame.png" height="250"> </a>
  <p> This was my first game I created in the Scratch Program. <br> It was a game that taught you the names of famous paintings <br> 
  from famous artists. It was my first program I did with a partner. <br> You can find my SCRUM <a href="SCRUM.xlsx"> here. </a> </p>

  <h2>
  My First Python Game </h2>
  <a href="https://repl.it/DbWk/21">
  <img src="scottsboro_game.PNG" height="150"> </a>
  <p> This was my very first python game I ever made. <br> We were told to connect the game to another class we were taking. <br> 
  I was learning about the Scottsboro Trials in English which became the basis of this game. <br> 
  You can find my flowchart <a href="https://www.draw.io/?chrome=0&lightbox=1&edit=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draw.io%2F%23G0Bz9SVLRsQ1MoQjl3MUU3SUlOUzA&nav=1#G0Bz9SVLRsQ1MoQjl3MUU3SUlOUzA"> here. </a> </p>

  <img src="/Portfolio/tetrisgame.jpg" height="250" width="350"> </a>
  <p> This was Tetris in python with my partner Lucas. This project was extremely hard to create but extremely rewarding once finished. You can check it out by clicking the picture to the left.
  <b> NOTE: You need to have pygame installed to run the program. You can download it <a href="/Portfolio/pygame64bit.zip"> here.</a> Once it is downloaded to your PC and open canopy. Make sure all your packages are up to date. 
  Go to the Tools tab and select the canopy command prompt. Type in 'pip install pygame' and you're all done! </b></p>

  <h2> Big Data Project</h2>

  <img src="../Images/Big Data Project.PNG" height="250" width="350"> </a>
  <p>My partner and I were assigned the task of determining whether or not there was a corrlation between median household income and crime rates. We used many credible sources
  including the US Census Bureau and FBI Crime Statistics. We used techniques we learned in Python to crunch the numbers for us and create a nice visualization. To view the results
  you can click on the picture to the left. The code is called final.py.</p>

  <h2> Rebellion Simulation</h2>
  <a href="../Files/4.2.3 Zipped.zip" download>
  <img src="../Images/Calm.PNG" height="250"width="350"> </a>
  <p>My partner and I created a simulation that monitored how a population reacted to their leader, when their leader implemented different laws and traits. According to the requirements,
  we made the simulation follow Machiavelli's ideas. You can download the simulation by clicking on the picture to the left. You can mess around with the different variables and see how the 
  citizens react to his new laws. </p>
