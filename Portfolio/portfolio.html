<p> This was my second scratch project made during my CSP year. <br> I made a program about a old meme called Epic Sax Guy. <br> When C2 is pressed it will give you a little suprise! <br> Press space to stop the action. </p>

<p> This was my first game I created in the Scratch Program. <br> It was a game that taught you the names of famous paintings <br> from famous artists. It was my first program I did with a partner. <br> You can find my SCRUM <a href="SCRUM.xlsx"> here. </a> </p>

<p> This was my very first python game I ever made. <br> We were told to connect the game to another class we were taking. <br> I was learning about the Scottsboro Trials in English which became the basis of this game. <br> You can find my flowchart <a href="https://www.draw.io/?chrome=0&lightbox=1&edit=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draw.io%2F%23G0Bz9SVLRsQ1MoQjl3MUU3SUlOUzA&nav=1#G0Bz9SVLRsQ1MoQjl3MUU3SUlOUzA"> here. </a> </p>
