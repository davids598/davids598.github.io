	<p> Hello! My name is David S. I am 15 years old and am a student at Ayala High School. I have a little brother and a family that loves to ski. The above image was when I was in Mammoth Mountain snowboarding with my family. I started off skiing but I decided to start snowboarding instead. I enjoyed it more and now I even own my own board! </p>
